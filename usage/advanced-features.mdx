### `@AutoLogOutput` â€“ Periodic Logging of Fields and Methods

The `@AutoLogOutput` annotation is used to **periodically log the output of a field or method**.

This is especially useful for:

- Continuously logging the value of a **pose**, variable, or calculation that changes over time.
- Logging **static fields** and **static methods** that are not in an `@AutoLog` class.
- Logging a method **periodically** even if it is already in an `@AutoLog` class.

> ðŸ“Œ **Key Difference from `@AutoLog`:**  
> When using `@AutoLog`, **fields are logged periodically by default**, but **methods are only logged when explicitly called**.  
> With `@AutoLogOutput`, both fields and methods are logged **automatically at regular intervals**, even if the method is not being called.

This makes `@AutoLogOutput` a powerful tool for continuously tracking critical data points that may not be actively accessed during execution.

#### Logging Robot Pose

The Koala logger includes a convenient function for logging your robot's pose in the `Pose2d` format, making it easy to visualize the robot's position and orientation within AdvantageScope's 2D or 3D field views.

To log the robot's pose, simply call:

```java
KoalaLog.logPose2d("pose", x, y, heading, true);
```

- `"pose"` is the name of the log entry.
- `x`, `y` are the robot's coordinates (in meters).
- `heading` is the rotation angle (in radians).
- `true` posts it to the FTC Dashboard (currently as a string; full pose on the field coming soon)

Once logged, your robot's position will be rendered in real-time within AdvantageScope, either on a flat field map or in 3D mode, allowing for intuitive debugging and performance analysis.
