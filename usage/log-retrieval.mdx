# Log Puller – Downloading Logs from Your FTC Robot

This guide explains how to use the Log Puller tools provided in the [LogPuller directory](https://github.com/ori-coval/Koala-Log/tree/main/LogPuller) to download `.wpilog` files from your robot.

---

## 📥 Step 1: Download the Log Puller Executables

Visit the [LogPuller folder in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ori-coval/Koala-Log/tree/main/LogPuller) and download the following executables:

- `FTCLogPuller.exe` – Downloads logs from the robot
- `PullAndDeleteLogs.exe` – Downloads logs **and deletes** them from the robot

> ⚠️ The first time you run either `.exe`, you must be connected to the **internet** (but **not** connected to the robot). This allows it to automatically download the ADB tool.

## 🔌 Step 2: Connect to the Robot Using ADB

You can connect to your robot in one of two ways:

### Option A: Wi-Fi (Wireless ADB)

1. Connect your PC to the robot’s Wi-Fi network.
2. Open the [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client).

### Option B: USB-C Cable (Wired ADB)

1. Connect your PC to the Control Hub using a USB-C cable.
2. Open the [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client).

For detailed instructions on wireless ADB setup, refer to [REV’s guide](https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/managing-the-control-system/android-studio-using-wireless-adb).

## ▶️ Step 3: Run the Executables

Once connected to the robot:

1. Run `FTCLogPuller.exe` or `PullAndDeleteLogs.exe`.
2. Choose a destination folder on your computer when prompted.
3. The logs will be downloaded to that location.

> 🗑️ `PullAndDeleteLogs.exe` will **delete logs** from the robot after downloading. Use this option if you want to clear storage on the Control Hub.

You're now ready to inspect your logs in tools like [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope)!
