### üöÄ How to Add to Your FTC Project

To start logging FTC data in the `.wpilog` format, follow these steps:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add the JitPack Repository

In your `TeamCode/build.gradle` file, add the following **below the `android` block**:

```groovy
android {
    // your existing config...
}

repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the Dependencies

Still in `TeamCode/build.gradle`, add the following inside the `dependencies` block:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.ori-coval.Koala-Log:KoalaLogger:<version>'
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.ori-coval.Koala-Log:KoalaLoggingProcessor:<version>'
}
```

> üîÅ Replace `<version>` with the latest version:  
> [![](https://jitpack.io/v/ori-coval/Koala-Log.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#ori-coval/Koala-Log)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Required: FTC Dashboard

This logger uses [FTC Dashboard](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard) to post live values.
You **must** add FTC Dashboard to your project for it to work correctly. Follow the official instructions here:  
üìö [How to Add FTC Dashboard](https://github.com/acmerobotics/ftc-dashboard?tab=readme-ov-file#basic)

# FTC Auto Logger ‚Äì How To Use

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before logging can begin, you need to make a few changes to your OpMode:

1. **Initialize the Logger**  
   Add the following line inside your OpMode's `init()` method:
   ```java
   KoalaLog.setup(hardwareMap);
   ```
2. **Enable Periodic Logging**  
   Add this line inside your `loop()` or `run()` method:
   ```java
   AutoLogManager.periodic();
   ```
   > This call logs all data from classes marked with `@AutoLog`.

---

## üìù Auto Logging with `@AutoLog`

The `@AutoLog` annotation allows you to automatically log and publish supported data types from any public fields or methods.

### ‚úÖ Supported Features

- Automatically logs **public fields** of supported types.
- Logs **methods or suppliers** returning supported types when they are called.
- Publishes data to both `.wpilog` and the [FTC Dashboard](https://acmerobotics.github.io/ftc-dashboard/).

### üß™ Example Usage

Annotate your class with `@AutoLog`:

```java
@AutoLog
public class ExampleSubsystem {
    public double encoderPosition;
    public boolean isBusy() {
        return someCondition;
    }
}
```

### üè∑Ô∏è Accessing the Logged Version

When using an auto-logged class, use the generated `<ClassName>AutoLogged` instead of your original class:

```java
// Instead of this:
ExampleSubsystem example = new ExampleSubsystem();
// Use this:
ExampleSubsystemAutoLogged example = new ExampleSubsystemAutoLogged();
```

### @DoNotLog

Adding `@DoNotLog` above a field or method will make sure it is not logged.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Manual Logging

You can also log values manually using the `KoalaLog.log()` function.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

```java
KoalaLog.log("BatteryVoltage", voltageSensor.getVoltage(), true);
```

### Parameters

- **Name** (`String`): The label for the log entry.
- **Value**: A supported data type (e.g., `double`, `boolean`, etc.).
- **Post to Dashboard** (`boolean`): Whether to also publish the value to FTC Dashboard.

# Log Puller ‚Äì Downloading Logs from Your FTC Robot

This guide explains how to use the Log Puller tools provided in the [LogPuller directory](https://github.com/ori-coval/Koala-Log/tree/main/LogPuller) to download `.wpilog` files from your robot.

---

## üì• Step 1: Download the Log Puller Executables

Visit the [LogPuller folder in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ori-coval/Koala-Log/tree/main/LogPuller) and download the following executables:

- `FTCLogPuller.exe` ‚Äì Downloads logs from the robot
- `PullAndDeleteLogs.exe` ‚Äì Downloads logs **and deletes** them from the robot

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The first time you run either `.exe`, you must be connected to the **internet** (but **not** connected to the robot). This allows it to automatically download the ADB tool.

---

## üîå Step 2: Connect to the Robot Using ADB

You can connect to your robot in one of two ways:

### Option A: Wi-Fi (Wireless ADB)

1. Connect your PC to the robot‚Äôs Wi-Fi network.
2. Open the [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client).

### Option B: USB-C Cable (Wired ADB)

1. Connect your PC to the Control Hub using a USB-C cable.
2. Open the [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client).

For detailed instructions on wireless ADB setup, refer to [REV‚Äôs guide](https://docs.revrobotics.com/duo-control/managing-the-control-system/android-studio-using-wireless-adb).

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 3: Run the Executables

Once connected to the robot:

1. Run `FTCLogPuller.exe` or `PullAndDeleteLogs.exe`.
2. Choose a destination folder on your computer when prompted.
3. The logs will be downloaded to that location.

> üóëÔ∏è `PullAndDeleteLogs.exe` will **delete logs** from the robot after downloading. Use this option if you want to clear storage on the Control Hub.

You're now ready to inspect your logs in tools like [AdvantageScope](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageScope)!

### `@AutoLogOutput` ‚Äì Periodic Logging of Fields and Methods

The `@AutoLogOutput` annotation is used to **periodically log the output of a field or method**.

This is especially useful for:

- Continuously logging the value of a **pose**, variable, or calculation that changes over time.
- Logging **static fields** and **static methods** that are not in an `@AutoLog` class.
- Logging a method **periodically** even if it is already in an `@AutoLog` class.

> üìå **Key Difference from `@AutoLog`:**  
> When using `@AutoLog`, **fields are logged periodically by default**, but **methods are only logged when explicitly called**.  
> With `@AutoLogOutput`, both fields and methods are logged **automatically at regular intervals**, even if the method is not being called.

This makes `@AutoLogOutput` a powerful tool for continuously tracking critical data points that may not be actively accessed during execution.

#### Logging Robot Pose

The Koala logger includes a convenient function for logging your robot's pose in the `Pose2d` format, making it easy to visualize the robot's position and orientation within AdvantageScope's 2D or 3D field views.

To log the robot's pose, simply call:

```java
KoalaLog.logPose2d("pose", x, y, heading, true);
```

- `"pose"` is the name of the log entry.
- `x`, `y` are the robot's coordinates (in meters).
- `heading` is the rotation angle (in radians).
- `true` posts it to the FTC Dashboard (currently as a string; full pose on the field coming soon)

Once logged, your robot's position will be rendered in real-time within AdvantageScope, either on a flat field map or in 3D mode, allowing for intuitive debugging and performance analysis.
